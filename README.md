## Electric Dipole Field

A small step toward visual representation of electric fields.
This project explores the electric field of a dipole through numerical computation
and 2D visualization in Python.


## Planned features

- Improved documentation and code clarity
- Animated electric field visualization

## Next steps

- [ ] Add inline comments and docstrings
- [ ] Refactor field computation
- [ ] Implement animated field representation
