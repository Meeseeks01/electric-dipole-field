## Electric Field Visualization (Dipole & Four Charges)

A small step toward visual representation of electric fields.
This project explores electric fields generated by point charges through numerical
computation and 2D visualization in Python.

Both a simple (for now :neutral_face: ) electric dipole and a four-charge configuration are implemented,
with explicit rendering of the charge positions (bodies) alongside the field lines.

The electric field is computed using Coulomb’s law on a 2D grid and visualized
using stream plots for intuitive interpretation.

## Current features

- Electric field computation for point charges
- Dipole configuration (two opposite charges)
- Four-charge configuration (quadrupole-like arrangement)
- 2D streamplot visualization of electric field lines
- Explicit visualization of positive and negative charges
- Correctly defined spatial domain and aspect ratio

### Electric Dipole

- Two point charges of equal magnitude and opposite sign  
- Field lines originate at the positive charge and terminate at the negative charge  
- Characteristic dipole symmetry is preserved

- Four point charges arranged symmetrically with alternating signs  
- Quadrupole-like electric field structure  
- Clear regions of field cancellation and enhanced curvature

## Planned features

- Improved documentation and code clarity
- Animated electric field visualization

## Next steps

- [ ] Add inline comments and docstrings
- [ ] Refactor field computation for clarity and reuse
- [ ] Implement animated field representation
