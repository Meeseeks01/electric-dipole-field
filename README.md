Electric Dipole Field

A small step toward visual representation of electric fields.
This project explores the electric field of a dipole through numerical computation
and 2D visualization in Python.


## Next steps

:exclamation: Add inline comments and docstrings to better document the physics and code structure
:exclamation: Refactor the field computation for improved readability and performance
:exclamation: Extend the static visualization to an animated electric field representation
